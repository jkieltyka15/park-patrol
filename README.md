# Park Patrol

Ranger Rachel stood at the edge of Pleasant Park, her eyes scanning the horizon where thick plumes of smoke rose ominously into the orange sky. The sun, hidden behind a veil of ash, cast a sickly glow over the forest. Fires were nothing new in the park—climate change had made sure of that—but today, the flames weren't the only threat.

Something far worse was lurking in the park.

The fire ants had always been a nuisance, but this summer, they’d become something else entirely. As the climate shifted, so had the ants—mutated, twisted by the extreme heat and conditions. They weren’t just attacking in swarms anymore. They had developed something terrifying. A biological weapon that no ranger manual had prepared her for.

Flamethrowers.
